  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
